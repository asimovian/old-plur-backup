Refactor SQL Statement data-model out of DB Request prototype. Build new model based on new Tree prototypes.

DB Request should be refactored into SQL DB Request and should manage an array of statements to be sent to the SQL DB Service.

DB Find Service should be refactored into SQL DB Service and accept any valid SQL statement.
